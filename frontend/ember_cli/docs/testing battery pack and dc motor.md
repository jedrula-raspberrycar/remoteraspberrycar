<!-- TODO what motor -->
To test battery pack and a motor I
1. connect 4 batteries together to have around 6V
2. attach one end of red wire to batteries chain (+ by convention) and second end to dc motor end 1
3. attach one end of black wire to batteries chain (- by convention) and second end to dc motor end 2

this should make your motor turn. If it doesn't:
a) your batteries might be old
b) you might have some issue with wiring
c) dc motor is malfunctioning
