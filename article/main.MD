This is an article about creating a toy car controlled by raspberry pi steered remotely over the internet

Lets split up our concerns

1. Toy Car

1.1. Parts:
  raspberry pi 
  wifi dongle
  a 3 wheel ( two engines run from some sort of battery) car, see: https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar/blob/master/car_image.jpg 
  power bank for raspberry (I used something you normally use for a cell phone) 
  l298n motor board module https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar/blob/master/l298n.jpg

1.2. Wiring up the car
1.2.1. "Debugging the engine"

2. Backend
2.1. Environment setup
2.1.1 installing system on raspberry pi 
      setting up wifi
      accessing pi using ssh
      npm && nodejs
      installing git

3. Node.js application
3.1. getting engine to run from node console
3.2. simple node program to run the engine
3.3. creating a wheel abstraction
3.4. adding an express server
3.5. creating a call from postman

4. Client application
4.1.
