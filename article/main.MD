Lets split up our concerns

1. Toy Car

1.1. Parts:
  raspberry pi

  a 3 wheel ( two engines run from some sort of battery) car, see: https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar/blob/master/car_image.jpg
  power bank for raspberry (I used something you normally use for a cell phone)

1.2. Wiring up the car

2. Backend
2.1. Environment setup
2.1.1 installing system on raspberry pi
