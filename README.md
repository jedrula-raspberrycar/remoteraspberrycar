#Project for remote controlling a raspberry pi car. 
### Brains of the Pi: nodejs
### Web client: Ember app.

what you need:

1. raspberry pi
2. a 3 wheel ( two engines run from some sort of battery) car, see: https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar/blob/master/car_image.jpg
3. power bank for raspberry
4. l298n motor control board, see: https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar/blob/master/l298n.jpg

to setup and start the app on raspberry pi:

1. connect raspberry to the carger and to the ethernet cable
2. read ip address of raspberry from your router admin paner, sth like: http://192.168.0.1/dhcp.htm
3. ssh pi@192.168.0.1 or pi@192.168.0.150 or something along those lines(password raspberry)
4. install nodejs and npm #TODO provide a link
5. ssh into raspberry pi
6. download project from repo https://github.com/jedrula/remoteraspberrycar.git to remoteraspberrycar folder (TODO provide better instructions on how to get the app to the pi)
7. cd remoteraspberrycar
8. npm install
9. npm start (TODO provide more information on how to start the program as a service on the pi)


to setup and start the web client 

1. clone the repo and enter its directory

2. cd frontend/ember_cli

3. start ember app

  ember serve --environment production (TODO this probably won't work as you need to modify the dynamically set host api of your pi)  

4. for frontend development with mirage

  ember serve --environment development


Troubleshooting:

  express gets requests but engine does not respond to command - maybe you are not running node app with sudo

  to restart raspberry you can try this from ssh:
  `sudo shutdown -r now`

  `sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save off`
